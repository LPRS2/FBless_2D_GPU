INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'clk_24MHz_i', used in period specification
   'TS_CLK', was traced into DCM_SP instance clk_gen/dcm_24MHz_to_100MHz. The
   following new TNM groups and period specifications were generated at the
   DCM_SP output(s): 
   CLKFX: <TIMESPEC TS_clk_gen_clk_fx = PERIOD "clk_gen_clk_fx" TS_CLK /
   4.166666667 HIGH 50%>

WARNING:NgdBuild:1212 - User specified non-default attribute value (41.66667)
   was detected for the CLKIN_PERIOD attribute on DCM
   "clk_gen/dcm_24MHz_to_100MHz".  This does not match the PERIOD constraint
   value (37.037 ns.).  The uncertainty calculation will use the non-default
   attribute value.  This could result in incorrect uncertainty calculated for
   DCM output clocks.
